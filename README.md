inneractive-android
===================
Thank you for looking at Inneractive's SDK!
The InneractiveAdSDK provides a simple way to integrate inneractive ads into mobile applications based on the Android platform. The SDK enables partners to retrieve ads – including rich media ads – and embed them into applications designed for Android 2.2 and newer.


## Integration
Integration instructions are available on the Inneractive [Wiki](https://confluence.inner-active.com/display/DevWiki/Android+SDK+guidelines).
This document begins by first explaining how to integrate ads into your application using either XML or Java code.  It then goes on to show you how to harness inneractive's highly targeted ad system by providing additional information with your requests.  Finally, you'll see how to receive and act upon events such as the user clicking an ad. 
But first, let's look at requesting an ad for display.
